         <h1>WHAT IS HTML?</h1>
         <p> <strong>Html</strong> is called hyper text markup language. It is basically
         used to show the presentation of a webpage. It's basically the foundation upon
         which every single webpage is laid.  Html is designed to be displayed on a 
         browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <strong>
             Cascading style sheets (CSS)</strong> and scripting languages such
             <strong>Javascript.</strong>    
        </p>
        <p>Web browsers receive <strong>HTML</strong> documents from a web server or from a local
            storage and render the documents into multimedia pages.<strong>HTML</strong> elements are
            the building blocks of <strong>HTML</strong> pages. <strong>HTML</strong> can embed programs written in scripting
            language such as Javascript, which affect the behaviour and content of the web
            pages. Inclusion of <strong>CSS</strong> defines the look and layout of content.
        </p>
         <h2>HTML TAGS</h2>
         <p><strong>HTML</strong> tags are like keywords which defines how web 
            browsers will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web
            browser can distinguish between an html content and a simple content. 
            <strong>HTML</strong> tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content,
            and closing tag. Every tag in <strong>HTML</strong>perform different tasks.
